Yes, this took a while. Good things take time. However, good is subjective, and I have now made myself understand that this is good; largely due to [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost). But I’d be lying. I wanted to dabble into React, CMSs and deploying to the edge. This jump has been an immense learning experience in this regard.

On the new blog, I intend to keep the [repo](https://github.com/Ayan-Choudhury-dev/ayan-choudhury-blog) public, where I have a list of to-dos as features. This is also why I switched to Astro – [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) despite being lightning fast and having a brilliant developer experience lacks in flexibility, particularly in documentation and troubleshooting tips.
