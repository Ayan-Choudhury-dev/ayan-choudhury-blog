Prior to joining [Era](https://era.app), I was a staff design engineer at Stripe, working on [stripe.com](https://stripe.com). In&nbsp;2020, we launched a [colorful new redesign](https://twitter.com/destroytoday/status/1280240842196889603).

I also led development of the landing pages for [Stripe Apps](https://stripe.com/apps), [Stripe Identity](https://stripe.com/identity), [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout), and [Stripe Terminal](https://stripe.com/terminal).
